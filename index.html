                reliability and automation are my job, mediating conflict between humans and technology is my passion.

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
                A native of the Pacific Northwest. I love working with people to build exceptional, simple,
                and reliable web services. I strive to write clean, readable, and maintainable code, sometimes falling
                short, but always learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                A few years ago I made a life-changing decision to leave my job as a Marketing Manager at a Portland
                based IT company and learn to code. It couldn't have worked out any better. I was one of the first
                members of the newly formed Site Reliability Team at The Home Depot QuoteCenter in Vancouver WA where I
                have been fortunate to learn and grow alongside a generous cast of characters, mentors, and friends.
